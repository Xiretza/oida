# Usage: cfg VAR:-DEFAULT
#
# Declare a configuration parameter. If if ${VAR} is currently unset, i.e. it
# was undefined in the environment, it is set to DEFAULT. In either case ${VAR}
# is made readonly.

    eval "unset _${1%%:*} ${1%%:*}; _${1%%:*}=\${$1}"
    eval "readonly ${1%%:*}=\"\$_${1%%:*}\"; unset _${1%%:*}"
}

# Usage: sed_cfg SED_ARGS
#
# Construct a sed command line to replace occurrences of each variable in the
# current shell session begining with `CFG_` by their value and run it with
# SED_ARGS appended.
#
# Examples:
#
#   $ sed_cfg -i somefile.foo
#   $ cat somefile.bla | sed_cfg > /there/somefile.bla
