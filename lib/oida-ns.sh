# The [ns module] allows saving, copying and restoring the namespace context of
# the shell.

# Usage: ns_open FD_VAR= [mnt|net|cgroup..]...
#
# Open the given types of namespace references from /proc/self/ns and place them
# in the associative array named by FD_VAR. We do it this way because string
# expansion forces a subshell which would make opening the file descriptors
# futile, also being able to reference a specific type to ns is useful!
