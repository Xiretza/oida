# Usage: overlay_mount SOURCE_DIR TARGET_DIR
#
# Mount an overlayfs at $TARGET_DIR, using $SOURCE_DIR as the lower (read-only)
# base to start from. New files will be written to '${TARGET_DIR}.overlay'.
#
# Note this simple wrapper only one allows one overlay mount per TARGET_DIR
# because of the naming convention.
