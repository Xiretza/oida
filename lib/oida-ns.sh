# The [ns module] allows saving, copying and restoring the namespace context of
# the shell.

# Usage: ns_open FD_ARRAY= NS_DIR [mnt|net|cgroup..]...
#
# Open the given types of namespace references from /proc/self/ns and place
# them in the associative array named by FD_ARRAY. We do it this way
# because string expansion forces a subshell which would make opening the
# file descriptors futile, also being able to reference a specific type to
# ns is useful!

	declare -Ag "$var"

		exec {fd}<"$dir/$ty"
		eval "$var[\$ty]=\$fd"

# Usage: ns_close FD_ARRAY
#
# Close the file descriptors in the named array and unset the array.
#
# Example:
#   ns_open NS_FDs /proc/self/ns mnt net
#   ns_close NS_FDs

# Usage: ns_mount SRC_DIR TARGET_DIR NS_TYPE...
#
# Mount the namespace references with the given NS_TYPEs from SRC_DIR to
# corresponding files in DEST_DIR.
#
# Example:
#   ns_mount /proc/self/ns /some/dir mnt net
#
