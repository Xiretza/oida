# Usage: unshare_rootro [-w WORKDIR] [-n]
#
# Unshare the mount and (optionally) the network namespaces and remount (almost)
# all filesystems read-only. The structure of the host's mounts is preserved,
# only the rw status of each mountpoint is changed.
#
# Writable directories in the new mount namespace:
# - /run: A fresh tmpfs is mounted here
# - /tmp: The host /tmp dir (rw)
# - WORKDIR: If given has it's rw status preserved
#
# Options:
# - if `-n` is given the network namespace is also unshared,
# - if `-w WORKDIR` is given the direcrory WORKDIR's writeability is preserved.
#
# Environment
# - in $RUNDIR (see oida-rundir.sh)
# - in $host_rw_ns[mnt]
